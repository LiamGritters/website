Carleton University Development Initiative (CUDI) was a club I started in 3rd year university with some peers to allow students to develop their ideas using resources on the Carleton University campus. Our goal was to assist students in creating working models of their ideas that will hopefully flourish into a business. By forming this club, we have been able to gather resources, funds and expertise on campus that would be difficult or unattainable for one student to do alone.

The idea to start this club began when I was in second year trying to get more involved. I have always wanted to pursue some of my ideas, but have failed to continue on past the design phase. This club was created to prevent that, to allow for each idea to develop, to allow for students to form a business, and to allow Carleton students to show how capable and creative we can be.

As the Club President, I collaborated with other organizations in the Ottawa community and the Carleton Campus to develop relationships and gain resources for projects. I also connected students with suitable mentors or other skilled students to develope their project further.
