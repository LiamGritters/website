## Idea

CRAM is an online library of tutorials for university courses in Canada. The unique aspect about CRAM is that we have students teaching fellow students with laid out material, concise articulate videos and a programmed learning process. Moreover, each class is university specific and teaches the content that would be taught in that particular class at that university.

CRAM requires students to pay 25 dollars per course and create an account. Before paying, students can view the first two lessons free. Upon purchasing a course, the student will have access to all videos, as well as quizzes, practice problems, and practice midterms/exams.

You can choose to only watch a few videos at your pace, or CRAM all of the lessons at once. Each course can usually be completed in 8 hours or less.

## Implementation

A minimal viable product was implemented using wordpress (https://www.cram-uni.com/). However with all the other work and distractions at the time, I never continued with the project...
